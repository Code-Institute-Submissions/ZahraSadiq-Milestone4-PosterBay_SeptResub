### Design:

I opted for a clean & minimalistic but modern look & feel for this website. The background is kept white to allow for the colorful imagery of the posters to stand out, while the buttons are given a bright yellow hover effect to add a fun and young element to the website.

* Color Scheme:
  * The main colors used are Black, White, Yellow and pops of bright pink.

* Typography:
  * All Headers use Inconsolata, a sans-serif font with nice letter-spacing - to give the website an artistic and fun kind of comic book touch.
  * Montserrat is my secondary font, used for paragraphs. It has a lighter font-weight, which pairs nicely with other sans-serif fonts and is easy to read on smaller devices.
  * Sans-Serif is used as the backup font for both Inconsolata and Montserrat to stay consistent with the font-family. 

* Imagery:
  * A bright, colorful abstract image is used for the hero image to be eye-catching & inviting to the user and stay consistent with the “modern/contemporary” art theme.
* The artworks for the posters speak for themselves - they are eye-catching, fun, young and really enticing choices to use as posters in one’s home. 
* The banners for the blogs are also bright and fun to attract users to click on the blog posts and learn more about the artists.

## Features :clipboard:

The site contains certain features which are not visible or available to unregistered/logged out users. 
### Features visible to All Users:
* **Shop All Products**
   * * The Shop page contains an assortment of products sold by Poster Bay. Each product card displays an image of the item, the name, artist name, price and a CTA button to view the product. This page also contains a search bar to allow users to quickly find a product based on search query.
* **Register**
   * The register feature is one visible to all users as a link on the navigation bar. Once clicked, it leads to a form where users can create a unique username and password.

Once the user has registered successfully, they will be redirected to the homepage. A success message also flashes at the top of the page signalling a successful registration.
* **Login**
   * The login feature is also visible to all users and can be found in the navigation bar. It enables users who already have a profile to login with their credentials. If the credentials don't match those entered during registration, an error message “Incorrect Username and/or Password” will flash across the screen. For users who have not registered yet, a CTA link at the bottom of the form directs them to register. Alternatively, if the login is successful and the username & password match those stored in the database, a welcome message will flash & the user will be redirected to the homepage.
* **Product Details Page**

* iPhone 11 - Safari
* iPhone 6 - Safari
* iPhone 6s - Safari
* iPad Air 2 - Safari

### 5. Bugs & Problems

Two Bugs & Two Styling Issue were found during Testing:
* During testing it was found that Webhook handler response fails even though order is processed and appears in both Stripe developer portal and in Admin displaying a 400 error. Due to this error, an order confirmation email is also not sent out. Due to time restraints, I was not able to investigate deeper. 
* It was also found that the first name and last name fields are not updated and saved in the my profile section once a user has filled in all their details and gone through the checkout process with the save info checkbox ticked. Various attempts were made to troubleshoot the issue but every time an attempt was made it resulted in Attribute Errors. Due to time restraints, I was not able to investigate deeper on this issue either, but I realize it could be fixed perhaps by changing the first_name & last_name fields to full_name as it is shown in the tutorials in the models.py, views.py and forms.py under checkout.
* The first styling issue found during testing was the footer on the "My Profile" page, which appears with large margins on both sides of it. I was not able to tackle this issue, but is something I would like to fix at a later date.
* The second styling issue involves the bag page in the checkout. On mobile devices, the UX is not up to standard as the user needs to scroll to the side in order to see the full bag overview. This is also something I would like to fix at a later date.
